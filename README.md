# Counterfactual Regression and Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`x_counterfacts.ipynb`) that explores different regression techniques and neural networks for predictive modeling.

## 📂 Contents
- **Simple Regression** – Introduction to linear regression with basic examples.  
- **Multiple Linear Regression** – Extends regression to multiple variables.  
- **Neural Network Regression** – Demonstrates a simple feed-forward neural net for regression tasks.  

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required libraries with:
